# Bleak-Complex-Modfiles

Please note, this is a work in progress, I have not gone through and done a polish pass yet, some rooms will be missing sounds, connections, or other things

The project and mod files for my rainworld mod "bleak complex"
Mod files contains the files for the mod, put this into your Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods folder
Project files contains the files for the level editor, I use some custom tiles but not many, I would reccomend installing the repo for ease of use.
Room screenshots, should contain most of the rooms, might have some out of date screenshots though
